Acknowledgements
----------------

The Twisted Project and the entire Twisted community for the strong
grounding in `Evented
Async <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/core/howto/async.html>`__.
Libor Michalek and Slide Inc for showing me using `Python
coroutines <https://github.com/slideinc/gogreen>`__ at phenomenal scale
isn't completely insane. Mike Johnston and Fred Cheng for
`Simplenote <http://simplenote.com/>`__,
`Simperium <https://simperium.com/>`__, the chance to experiment with
how apps will work with realtime APIs and for making it possible for me
to live in San Francisco. `Littleinc <http://littleinc.com>`__ for
giving me a chance to send a lot of messages and to open source `this
project <https://github.com/cablehead/vanilla>`__ which I started
working on while there. Justin Rosenthal for believing in me, 30% of the
time. Andres Buritica who did a lot of the early HTTP and UDP fragment
(not pushed just yet!) work and Alison Kosinski, the coolest wife in
the world.
